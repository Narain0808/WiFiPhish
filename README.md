# WiFiPhish
 WiFiPhish is a social engineering tool using an ESP8266 to mimic a WiFi upgrade process, tricking users into entering their WiFi password. It sets up a rogue access point with a captive portal that displays a fake "WiFi upgrade" page. The entered password is then checked against a captured WPA2 handshake for validation.
